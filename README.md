## Using the Ontario dataset and Toronto weather dataset, we decided to merge dataframes.

## Data Analysis
By 24th Feb. 2020, ten travelers had arrived Canada from Wuhan, China. Seven of them
landed in British Columbia and three in Ontario. One of the three cases was in London.
The other two, both in their 50s, were in Toronto.

Now, let’s look at the numbers in Ontario four months later and a deep dive into weather conditions in
Toronto later in this analysis.


### Which regions in Ontario were affected?

From April to May, there was a 25% decrease in the number of cases, while from May to June, there was a huge decline of 42% in the number of cases. By the end of June, New Liskeard did not report any cases.

### Outcome of the total cases
Resolved cases – 87.3%

Fatal cases – 7.5%

Not Resolved cases – 5.1% 



### How was the virus contracted?

### What roles do weather conditions play in the spread of the virus in Toronto?

### Implications of Findings
Some of the reported cases in Ontario occurred in cities closes to the US borders, suggesting border travel might have added to the spread.
The most common means of contracting the virus was due to lack of proper precautions.
Densely populated cities contributed largely to the fast spread in Ontario.
In February, symptoms were not being reported because the virus was not classified severe or a pandemic at the time. In March, the virus was considered a pandemic and reported cases increased significantly but started reducing by the end of May and June.


## Conclusions
In Ontario, major cities were severely impacted including Toronto (largest numbers) and GTA.
April 2020 was the peak spread of the virus as it had the most cases in Ontario.
Females had a higher mortality rate but also a higher recovery rate than males.
Females were mostly contracting the virus through the outbreak spread, while males were mostly contracting the virus through close contact with known infected people.
